1. Never start a server on your own unless I explicitly ask you to, assume it is already running. If you ever think the server isn't running, just pause and let me know and I will start it and then tell you to continue. If you need to self-test a new feature to check for bugs, go ahead and do it and assume the server is alread running on port 8000.
2. Do not do things that are beyond the scope of what i've asked you. If you have ideas or new features, or a better way to impliment and existing features, present your ideas to me, and then I may approve them. But as much as possible, limit your work to just the scope of the prompt I've given you. If you are ever unsure if something is in the scope of the prompt, wait before doing it and ask me for approval.
3. If what I'm asking you to do will take a large amount of code, or editing a lot things at once, provide a gameplan of how to complete the task in multiple steps, and then wait for me to tell you to do each step.
